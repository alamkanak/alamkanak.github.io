This is a portfolio website styled same as linear.app design. This will be hosted on GitHub Pages.
Implement a nuxt ui theme for this inspired by linear.app. 
Use #Context7 to gather docs on nuxt 4, nuxt ui, tailwind etc. on how to implement it.
Implement theme in such a way so that I never have to hardcode any color, font, weight, rounding radius etc. in the components.
The theme should be fully customizable, and should support both light and dark modes.
