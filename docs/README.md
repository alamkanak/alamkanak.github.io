# GitHub Pages Deployment

This folder contains the automatically generated static site files for GitHub Pages deployment.

**⚠️ Do not manually edit files in this folder**

Files in this directory are automatically generated and updated by the GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) whenever changes are pushed to the master branch.

## How it works

1. **Push** changes to the `master` branch
2. **GitHub Actions** automatically builds your Nuxt application
3. **Static files** are generated and copied to this `docs/` folder
4. **GitHub Pages** serves the site from this folder
5. **Site** is available at https://alamkanak.github.io

## Last updated

This folder will be populated after the first successful deployment.

To trigger a deployment, push changes to the master branch or manually run the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow from the Actions tab.
